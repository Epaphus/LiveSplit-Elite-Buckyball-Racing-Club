# LiveSplit files for Buckyball Races

LiveSplit files and AutoSplitters for the Buckyball Racing Club, these are for the races outside of the championships.

Don’t know what [“LiveSplit”](https://livesplit.org) is? It allows you to time speedruns of your favourite games!

Based up on the LiveSplit files created by [alterNERDtive](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/LiveSplit-Elite-Magic-8-Ball-Championship) for the Magic 8-Ball Championship 

## Setup

1. Download LiveSplit from <https://livesplit.org/downloads/> and unzip it to a directory of your choosing.
2. Download this repository (green button in the top right of the repostory view → “Download ZIP”) and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, clone the git repository.
3. Launch LiveSplit and do the following:
   - Right click, Open Splits, select `[name of the race]\[name of the race].lss`.
   - Right click, Open Layout, select `Layout.lsl`.
   - Right click, Edit Layout, Layout Settings, then in “Scriptable Auto Splitter”, set `[name of the race]\[name of the race].asl` as the script path.
4. Right click, Save Layout As…, save to wherever. This means your changes in the layout (e.g. changing colours) and associating the auto splitter will not be lost on updates.

## Races

### Obfuscated In The Outer Rim. 23rd - 31st Dec 3309.

The AutoSplitter will start the timer once you undock from The Legacy. 

The splits should work for both Ophidian and Unlimited classes, however due time constraints I've only tested the Ophidian waypoints. Any issues let me know.

There are multiple options for the stops in unlimited class so the splits list the waypoint number.
